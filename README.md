# Clustering Project using CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) Algorithm

## Description
This project aims to evaluate the CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) clustering algorithm on one or more datasets. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar objects into clusters.<br>
This work explores the application of CLARA on one or more datasets, focusing on its effectiveness, evaluation metrics, and performance. Through this evaluation, we will determine to what extent CLARA can be an efficient algorithm for clustering tasks, possibly comparing it to other popular methods such as K-means and DBSCAN.<br>

## Functioning of CLARA in this project
Multiprocessing is a technique that enables multiple tasks to be executed in parallel using several distinct processes, thus distributing the workload over several cores or processors. 
Each process operates independently with its memory and resources, avoiding interference between processes. This speeds up program execution, particularly for complex or heavy tasks, while maximizing the use of computer resources.
